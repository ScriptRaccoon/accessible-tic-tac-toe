# Accessible Tic Tac Toe game

This repository contains two basic Tic Tac Toe games. The one in the subfolder "inaccessible_version" is not accessible. Several issues are indicated via comments in the HTML, the CSS and the JS files. These issues are resolved in the accessible version that can be found in the folder "accessible_version". The result is a game that is accessible via keyboard navigation and screen readers.
